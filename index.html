			<h2>Transplants</h2>
			<h3>READY TO GET STARTED?</h3>
			<p>Turkey offers the ideal conditions for a successful hair transplant. As such, it has been many years since the country has become a destination of choice for hair implants.</p>
			<p>But how is it possible to offer services at such competitive prices ? First of all, the cosmetic surgery industry is heavily subsidized by the Turkish state. Secondly the lower cost of living allows our hair implant to be more affordable than in Europe or the US. These are the reasons why we can offer very low prices without denying the quality of our transplants.</p>

				<div class="accordion-container">
					<div class="set">
						<a href="javascript:;" class="active"><span>Q1</span> What is Hair Transplantation?</a>
						<div class="content" style="display: block;">
							<p>A hair transplant is a surgical procedure in which hair is moved from the back and/or sides of the scalp, where it is permanent (donor area), to areas that are thinning or bald on the front, top, or crown of the scalp (recipient area). Once transplanted, the hair will continue to grow for a person’s lifetime. At HairPros we perform the two most effective types of hair restoration procedures, Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) and Direct Hair Implementation (DHI).</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="set">
						<a href="javascript:;"><span>Q2</span> What is Direct Hair Implementation (DHI)?</a>
						<div class="content">
							<p>In a Direct Hair Implantation (DHI) operation, the donor hair is removed individually with a special micro punch. In most cases, the donor area is at the middle back of the head, since compared to the front hairline or the crown, the back is usually not so severely affected by hair loss.</p>
							<p>The extracted hair is then stored in a special nutrient solution before implantation by a mini needle, the “Choi Pen”, which is used to implant the individual hair follicles to the scalp.</p>
							<p>Two great advantages of DHI comparing with FUE or FUT, are the fact that it’s much less prone to leave scars (unlike FUT), and patients with long hair don’t always have to shave their heads before the treatment.</p>							
							<p>Important to understand that due to longer operation time, DHI treatments are usually more suitable for patients with a lower number of grafts implemented.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="set">
						<a href="javascript:;"><span>Q3</span> What is Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE)?</a>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) is a method of extracting, or “harvesting”, follicular units one-by-one directly from the scalp. In FUE, an instrument is used to make small, circular incisions in the skin around follicular units, separating them from the surrounding tissue. The follicular unit is then extracted (pulled) directly from the scalp, leaving a small open hole that heals with a small white mark.</p>
							<p>This method of donor harvesting is what differentiates the FUE procedure from Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT), in which the donor hair is removed in a long strip that is dissected into individual follicular units under a stereo-microscope. The creation of recipient sites and the placing of follicular unit grafts are essentially the same in FUE and FUT procedures.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="set">
						<a href="javascript:;"><span>Q4</span> Am I a Candidate for a Hair Restoration Procedure?</a>
						<div class="content">
							<p>The best way to find out is to be evaluated by a board certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon specializing in hair restoration. The answer will depend on the cause of your hair loss, your age, the stability of your donor supply, how extensive your hair loss is, your expectations and a number of other important factors that will be taken into account. Ask us more and we’ll check your candidacy for a hair transplant surgery together.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="set">
						<a href="javascript:;"><span>Q5</span> Should I Choose DHI or FUE?</a>
						<div class="content">
							<p>DHI is more appropriate for patients who would like to keep their hair very short or who can’t limit strenuous activities in the post-op period. In general, younger patients who need to keep their styling options flexible choose DHI, whereas those who desire the most coverage opt for FUE. Ask us more a detailed comparison of DHI and FUE.</p>

<p>I was absolutely pleased with the entire process. From the consult, to the procedure, to the followups, True and Dorin was fantastic. I never felt pressured to go through with the procedure, and they took the time to explain every detail to me. I'm more than happy with my results and encourage anyone looking into a hair transplant, to go with True and Dorin!</p>

<p>On the 90th day after the hair transplant, the hair began to grow again after the shedding period, and the hair that had not fallen off before also grew quite long. The hair on the back of my head was also long, and there was no indication that the hair follicles had been taken out.</p>

<p>HairPros team advised me well before my arrival and my support during my stay (many thanks Jake!), the day of the intervention the Dr. and their team were professional and factual on my case by explaining to me and asking me for my opinions at all stages, I underline on this occasion the quality of care and the attention of his two assistants as well. I am at my 15th day after my transplant and I heal very well.</p>

<p>I was suffering from male bald pattern hair loss. It was affecting me, I knew I had to do something to regain my confidence again. I am glad to have engaged HairPros and their team for my hair transplant. I am satisfied with the results and it was a great experience. The HairPros team are sincere, approachable and very meticulous in their work. I was impressed by the realism with which the clinic approached the job - they did not over-promise and they were clear about what they could and couldn't do. The procedure itself was carried out professionally and efficiently. I would highly recommend HairPros.</p>
